  "description": "Classical CV training flow that loads CK+ frames, normalizes them to 64x64 grayscale, extracts HOG descriptors, and trains an RBF SVM. Includes evaluation output plus a saved svm_model.joblib artifact and a small inference script for single-image predictions.",
  "highlights": [
    "HOG descriptors with 7 orientations, 8x8 cells, 4x4 blocks",
    "70/30 train-test split with metrics reporting",
    "Inference script loads the saved model for one-off predictions"
