If you want to keep improving performance, the next highest-impact steps are:
1) Add a low‑power mode for mobile (lower dpr, fewer background layers, no meteor drop‑shadows).
2) Switch the 3D canvas to demand rendering when the page is idle.
3) Run a Lighthouse + Performance trace on npm run preview to quantify LCP/INP/CLS before/after.
