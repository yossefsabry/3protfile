# Ideas
- Subtle vignette: darken edges to pull focus to center.
- Soft “nebula” gradient layer: slow drifting blobs in warm amber + cool blue.
- Star twinkle: tiny subset with slow opacity pulse (very subtle).
- Parallax star layers: different drift speeds for depth.
- Light film grain: 3–5% noise to add texture and reduce banding.
- Faint radial glow behind the main 3D object to blend scene and stars.
